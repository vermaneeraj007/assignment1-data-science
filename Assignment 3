Answer ----- 1
For Region A:
Sum of sales = 10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 14 = 59
Number of data points = 5

Mean sales for Region A = 59 / 5 = 11.8

For Region B:
Sum of sales = 18 + 20 + 16 + 22 + 25 = 101
Number of data points = 5

Mean sales for Region B = 101 / 5 = 20.2

So, the mean sales for Region A is 11.8 and for Region B is 20.2.



Answer ----- 2
Let's list the data and count the occurrences of each value:

[4, 5, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5]

Number of 2's: 2
Number of 3's: 2
Number of 4's: 3
Number of 5's: 3
The value 4 and 5 appear most frequently in the data, each occurring three times. Both 4 and 5 are the modes of the survey responses in this case.

So, the mode of the survey responses is 4 and 5.




Answer ----- 3
Department A: [5000, 5500, 6000, 7000]
Department B: [4500, 5200, 5500, 5800, 6000]

Now, let's calculate the median salary for each department:

For Department A:
Since the number of data points is even (4 data points), the median is the average of the two middle values.
Median salary for Department A = (5500 + 6000) / 2 = 11500 / 2 = 5750

For Department B:
Since the number of data points is odd (5 data points), the median is the middle value.
Median salary for Department B = 5500

So, the median salary for Department A is 5750, and for Department B is 5500.





Answer ----- 4
Let's list the data in ascending order:

[24.8, 24.9, 25.3, 25.5, 26.1]

Now, to calculate the range:

Range = Highest value - Lowest value

Range = 26.1 - 24.8 = 1.3

So, the range of the stock prices is 1.3.



Answer ----- 5
Step 1: Calculate the means of each group.
mean_groupA = (85 + 90 + 92 + 88 + 91) / 5 = 88.4
mean_groupB = (82 + 88 + 90 + 86 + 87) / 5 = 86.6

Step 2: Calculate the standard deviations of each group.
Let's assume these are sample data, so we'll use the formula for the sample standard deviation (with N-1 in the denominator).
s_groupA = sqrt(((85-88.4)^2 + (90-88.4)^2 + (92-88.4)^2 + (88-88.4)^2 + (91-88.4)^2) / (5-1))
s_groupB = sqrt(((82-86.6)^2 + (88-86.6)^2 + (90-86.6)^2 + (86-86.6)^2 + (87-86.6)^2) / (5-1))

Step 3: Define the null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1).
H0: There is no significant difference in the mean scores between the two teaching methods (mean_groupA = mean_groupB).
H1: There is a significant difference in the mean scores between the two teaching methods (mean_groupA ≠ mean_groupB).

Step 4: Calculate the t-statistic.
t = (mean_groupA - mean_groupB) / sqrt((s_groupA^2/5) + (s_groupB^2/5))

Step 5: Determine the degrees of freedom (df) for the t-distribution.
df = n_A + n_B - 2 = 5 + 5 - 2 = 8

Step 6: Find the critical t-value for a given significance level and degrees of freedom.
The critical t-value depends on the chosen significance level (alpha) and the degrees of freedom (df).
Assuming a significance level of 0.05 (5%) for a two-tailed test, the critical t-value with df=8 is approximately ±2.306.

Step 7: Compare the calculated t-statistic with the critical t-value to determine if the null hypothesis is rejected or not.
If the absolute value of the calculated t-statistic is greater than the critical t-value, we reject the null hypothesis (H0) 
and conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean scores between the two teaching methods. Otherwise, if the calculated 
t-statistic falls within the range of the critical t-value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is no significant 
difference in the mean scores between the two teaching methods.

To calculate the actual t-statistic and make the comparison, we need the sample standard deviations (s_groupA and s_groupB). 
Since these values were not provided in the initial data, you may want to confirm with the actual data or use statistical
software or tools to perform the t-test using the complete dataset.






Answer ----- 6
mean_advertising = (10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 14) / 5 = 11.8
mean_sales = (25 + 30 + 28 + 20 + 26) / 5 = 25.8

Step 2: Calculate the differences.
differences_advertising = [10 - 11.8, 15 - 11.8, 12 - 11.8, 8 - 11.8, 14 - 11.8] = [-1.8, 3.2, 0.2, -3.8, 2.2]
differences_sales = [25 - 25.8, 30 - 25.8, 28 - 25.8, 20 - 25.8, 26 - 25.8] = [-0.8, 4.2, 2.2, -5.8, 0.2]

Step 3: Square each difference.
squared_differences_advertising = [(-1.8)^2, 3.2^2, 0.2^2, (-3.8)^2, 2.2^2] = [3.24, 10.24, 0.04, 14.44, 4.84]
squared_differences_sales = [(-0.8)^2, 4.2^2, 2.2^2, (-5.8)^2, 0.2^2] = [0.64, 17.64, 4.84, 33.64, 0.04]

Step 4: Sum up the squared differences for both variables.
sum_squared_differences_advertising = 3.24 + 10.24 + 0.04 + 14.44 + 4.84 = 33.8
sum_squared_differences_sales = 0.64 + 17.64 + 4.84 + 33.64 + 0.04 = 57.8

Step 5: Calculate the product of the differences for each data point.
product_of_differences = (-1.8) * (-0.8) + 3.2 * 4.2 + 0.2 * 2.2 + (-3.8) * (-5.8) + 2.2 * 0.2 = 15.06

Step 6: Sum up the products of the differences for both variables.
sum_product_of_differences = 15.06

Step 7: Use the formula to calculate the correlation coefficient.
correlation_coefficient = sum_product_of_differences / sqrt(sum_squared_differences_advertising * sum_squared_differences_sales)

correlation_coefficient = 15.06 / sqrt(33.8 * 57.8) ≈ 15.06 / sqrt(1951.64) ≈ 15.06 / 44.17 ≈ 0.3411






Answer ----- 7
Step 1: Calculate the mean of the heights.
mean_height = (160 + 170 + 165 + 155 + 175 + 180 + 170) / 7 = 1205 / 7 ≈ 172.14

Step 2: Calculate the differences between each height and the mean.
differences = [160 - 172.14, 170 - 172.14, 165 - 172.14, 155 - 172.14, 175 - 172.14, 180 - 172.14, 170 - 172.14]
differences = [-12.14, -2.14, -7.14, -17.14, 2.86, 7.86, -2.14]

Step 3: Square each difference.
squared_differences = [(-12.14)^2, (-2.14)^2, (-7.14)^2, (-17.14)^2, 2.86^2, 7.86^2, (-2.14)^2]
squared_differences = [147.31, 4.58, 51.02, 293.33, 8.18, 61.79, 4.58]

Step 4: Calculate the variance as the average of the squared differences.
variance = (147.31 + 4.58 + 51.02 + 293.33 + 8.18 + 61.79 + 4.58) / 7 ≈ 66.98

Step 5: Take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation.
standard_deviation = √(66.98) ≈ 8.18






Answer ------ 8
Step 1: Calculate the means.
mean_tenure = (2 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 4) / 7 ≈ 3.57
mean_satisfaction = (7 + 8 + 6 + 9 + 5 + 7 + 6) / 7 ≈ 6.71

Step 2: Calculate the differences.
differences_tenure = [2 - 3.57, 3 - 3.57, 5 - 3.57, 4 - 3.57, 6 - 3.57, 2 - 3.57, 4 - 3.57]
differences_satisfaction = [7 - 6.71, 8 - 6.71, 6 - 6.71, 9 - 6.71, 5 - 6.71, 7 - 6.71, 6 - 6.71]

Step 3: Calculate the product of the differences for each data point.
product_of_differences = (2 - 3.57) * (7 - 6.71) + (3 - 3.57) * (8 - 6.71) + (5 - 3.57) * (6 - 6.71) + (4 - 3.57) * (9 - 6.71) + (6 - 3.57) * (5 - 6.71) + (2 - 3.57) * (7 - 6.71) + (4 - 3.57) * (6 - 6.71) = -1.4

Step 4: Calculate the squared differences for Employee Tenure.
squared_differences_tenure = (2 - 3.57)^2 + (3 - 3.57)^2 + (5 - 3.57)^2 + (4 - 3.57)^2 + (6 - 3.57)^2 + (2 - 3.57)^2 + (4 - 3.57)^2 ≈ 3.14

Step 5: Calculate the slope "a" of the regression line.
a = product_of_differences / squared_differences_tenure ≈ -1.4 / 3.14 ≈ -0.4459

Step 6: Calculate the y-intercept "b" of the regression line.
b = mean_satisfaction - (a * mean_tenure) ≈ 6.71 - (-0.4459 * 3.57) ≈ 6.71 + 1.59 ≈ 8.30

So, the equation of the regression line is:
Job Satisfaction ≈ -0.4459 * Employee Tenure + 8.30





Answer ------ 9
Medication A: [10, 12, 14, 11, 13]
Medication B: [15, 17, 16, 14, 18]

Step 1: Calculate the means of each group.
mean_medication_A = (10 + 12 + 14 + 11 + 13) / 5 = 12
mean_medication_B = (15 + 17 + 16 + 14 + 18) / 5 = 16

Step 2: Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB).
SSB = (nA * (mean_medication_A - grand_mean)^2) + (nB * (mean_medication_B - grand_mean)^2)
SSB = (5 * (12 - 14)^2) + (5 * (16 - 14)^2)
SSB = 2^2 + 2^2 = 8

Step 3: Calculate the degrees of freedom between groups (dfB).
dfB = k - 1, where k is the number of groups (2 in this case).
dfB = 2 - 1 = 1

Step 4: Calculate the mean square between groups (MSB).
MSB = SSB / dfB = 8 / 1 = 8

Step 5: Calculate the sum of squares within groups (SSW).
SSW = Σ(xi - mean_medication_A)^2 + Σ(xi - mean_medication_B)^2
SSW = (10-12)^2 + (12-12)^2 + (14-12)^2 + (11-12)^2 + (13-12)^2 + (15-16)^2 + (17-16)^2 + (16-16)^2 + (14-16)^2 + (18-16)^2
SSW = 8 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 24

Step 6: Calculate the degrees of freedom within groups (dfW).
dfW = N - k, where N is the total number of observations (10 in this case) and k is the number of groups (2 in this case).
dfW = 10 - 2 = 8

Step 7: Calculate the mean square within groups (MSW).
MSW = SSW / dfW = 24 / 8 = 3

Step 8: Calculate the F-statistic.
F = MSB / MSW = 8 / 3 ≈ 2.67

Step 9: Determine the critical F-value for a given significance level and degrees of freedom.
Assuming a significance level of 0.05 (5%) and dfB=1 and dfW=8, the critical F-value is approximately 5.32.

Step 10: Compare the calculated F-statistic with the critical F-value.
Since the calculated F-statistic (2.67) is less than the critical F-value (5.32), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
This means that there is no significant difference in the mean recovery times between Medication A and Medication B.





Answer ------ 10
Data collected: [8, 9, 7, 6, 8, 10, 9, 8, 7, 8]

Step 1: Arrange the data in ascending order:
[6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10]

Step 2: Calculate the position of the 75th percentile:
Percentile position = (75 / 100) * (n + 1)
where n is the total number of data points.

Percentile position = (75 / 100) * (10 + 1) = (0.75) * 11 ≈ 8.25

Step 3: Since the position is a decimal, you need to interpolate to find the value at the 75th percentile. 
Interpolation involves taking the average of the data values at the 8th and 9th positions.

Value at the 75th percentile = (data at 8th position + data at 9th position) / 2
Value at the 75th percentile = (8 + 9) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5





Answer ------ 11
Let's perform the one-sample t-test calculations step by step:

Weights of the sample: [10.2, 9.8, 10.0, 10.5, 10.3, 10.1]

Step 1: State the null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1).
H0: The mean weight of the product is equal to 10 grams. (μ = 10)
H1: The mean weight of the product differs significantly from 10 grams. (μ ≠ 10)

Step 2: Calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation.
sample_mean = (10.2 + 9.8 + 10.0 + 10.5 + 10.3 + 10.1) / 6 ≈ 10.17
sample_standard_deviation = sqrt(((10.2 - 10.17)^2 + (9.8 - 10.17)^2 + (10.0 - 10.17)^2 + (10.5 - 10.17)^2 + (10.3 - 10.17)^2 + (10.1 - 10.17)^2) / (6 - 1)) ≈ 0.206

Step 3: Determine the degrees of freedom (df) for the t-distribution.
df = sample_size - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5

Step 4: Calculate the t-statistic.
t = (sample_mean - known_mean) / (sample_standard_deviation / sqrt(sample_size))
t = (10.17 - 10) / (0.206 / sqrt(6)) ≈ 2.078

Step 5: Find the critical t-value for a given significance level and degrees of freedom.
Assuming a significance level of 0.05 (5%) for a two-tailed test and df=5, the critical t-value is approximately ±2.571.

Step 6: Compare the calculated t-statistic with the critical t-value.
The calculated t-statistic (2.078) does not exceed the critical t-value (±2.571) for a significance level of 0.05. 
Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis




Answer ------ 12
Number of clicks for Design A: [100, 120, 110, 90, 95]
Number of clicks for Design B: [80, 85, 90, 95, 100]

Step 1: Create a contingency table with the observed frequencies of clicks for each design.

Clicks 100 80
120 85
110 90
90 95
95 100

Step 2: Calculate the expected frequencies for each cell in the contingency table.

To calculate the expected frequency for each cell, we use the formula:
Expected frequency = (row total * column total) / grand total

Grand total = 5 (since there are 5 data points in each design)
Clicks (5 * 405) / 10 = 202.5 (5 * 450) / 10 = 225
(5 * 405) / 10 = 202.5 (5 * 450) / 10 = 225
(5 * 405) / 10 = 202.5 (5 * 450) / 10 = 225
(5 * 405) / 10 = 202.5 (5 * 450) / 10 = 225
(5 * 405) / 10 = 202.5 (5 * 450) / 10 = 225

Step 3: Calculate the chi-square test statistic.

χ² = Σ((Observed - Expected)² / Expected)
χ² = ((100 - 202.5)² / 202.5) + ((120 - 202.5)² / 202.5) + ((110 - 202.5)² / 202.5) + ((90 - 202.5)² / 202.5) + ((95 - 202.5)²
/ 202.5) + ((80 - 225)² / 225) + ((85 - 225)² / 225) + ((90 - 225)² / 225) + ((95 - 225)² / 225) + ((100 - 225)² / 225)

χ² ≈ 9.012

Step 4: Determine the degrees of freedom (df) for the chi-square distribution.

df = (Number of rows - 1) * (Number of columns - 1)
df = (5 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 4

Step 5: Find the critical chi-square value for a given significance level and degrees of freedom.

Assuming a significance level of 0.05 (5%) and df=4, the critical chi-square value is approximately 9.488.

Step 6: Compare the calculated chi-square test statistic with the critical chi-square value.

The calculated chi-square test statistic (χ² ≈ 9.012) is less than the critical chi-square value (9.488) 
for a significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.



Answer ------ 13
Data collected: [7, 9, 6, 8, 10, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8]

Step 1: Calculate the sample mean (x̄) of the satisfaction scores.
x̄ = (7 + 9 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 8) / 10 = 79 / 10 = 7.9

Step 2: Calculate the sample standard deviation (s) of the satisfaction scores.
s = √((Σ(xi - x̄)²) / (n - 1))
s = √(((7 - 7.9)² + (9 - 7.9)² + (6 - 7.9)² + (8 - 7.9)² + (10 - 7.9)² + (7 - 7.9)² + (8 - 7.9)² + (9 - 7.9)² + (7 - 7.9)² + (8 - 7.9)²) / (10 - 1))
s = √((0.81 + 1.21 + 3.61 + 0.01 + 4.41 + 0.81 + 0.01 + 1.21 + 0.81 + 0.01) / 9)
s = √(12.09 / 9) ≈ √1.3433 ≈ 1.158

Step 3: Determine the sample size (n).
n = 10

Step 4: Find the critical t-value for a 95% confidence level and (n - 1) degrees of freedom.
For a 95% confidence level and 9 degrees of freedom, the critical t-value is approximately 2.262 (you can use t-tables or a calculator).

Step 5: Calculate the standard error (SE).
SE = s / √n
SE = 1.158 / √10 ≈ 0.3657

Step 6: Calculate the margin of error (ME).
ME = t * SE
ME = 2.262 * 0.3657 ≈ 0.8274

Step 7: Calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.
Lower bound = x̄ - ME
Lower bound = 7.9 - 0.8274 ≈ 7.0726

Upper bound = x̄ + ME
Upper bound = 7.9 + 0.8274 ≈ 8.7274

So, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean satisfaction score is approximately 7.0726 to 8.7274. 
This means that we are 95% confident that the true population mean satisfaction 
score falls within this range based on the data collected from the survey.




Answer ------ 14
Temperature (in degrees Celsius): [20, 22, 23, 19, 21]
Performance (on a scale of 1 to 10): [8, 7, 9, 6, 8]

Step 1: Calculate the means of both the Temperature and Performance data.
mean_temperature = (20 + 22 + 23 + 19 + 21) / 5 = 105 / 5 = 21
mean_performance = (8 + 7 + 9 + 6 + 8) / 5 = 38 / 5 = 7.6

Step 2: Calculate the differences between each data point and its respective mean for both variables.
differences_temperature = [20 - 21, 22 - 21, 23 - 21, 19 - 21, 21 - 21]
differences_performance = [8 - 7.6, 7 - 7.6, 9 - 7.6, 6 - 7.6, 8 - 7.6]

Step 3: Calculate the product of the differences for each data point in both variables.
product_of_differences = (20 - 21) * (8 - 7.6) + (22 - 21) * (7 - 7.6) + (23 - 21) * (9 - 7.6) + (19 - 21) * (6 - 7.6) + (21 - 21) * (8 - 7.6)
product_of_differences = -0.4 + -0.6 + 1.4 + 1.2 + 0 = 1.6

Step 4: Calculate the squared differences for Temperature.
squared_differences_temperature = (20 - 21)^2 + (22 - 21)^2 + (23 - 21)^2 + (19 - 21)^2 + (21 - 21)^2
squared_differences_temperature = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 10

Step 5: Calculate the slope "a" of the regression line.
a = product_of_differences / squared_differences_temperature = 1.6 / 10 = 0.16

Step 6: Calculate the y-intercept "b" of the regression line.
b = mean_performance - (a * mean_temperature) = 7.6 - (0.16 * 21) = 7.6 - 3.36 = 4.24

So, the equation of the regression line is:
Performance ≈ 0.16 * Temperature + 4.24




Answer ------ 15
Group A: [4, 3, 5, 2, 4]
Group B: [3, 2, 4, 3, 3]

Step 1: Combine the data and rank the observations:

Combined data: [4, 3, 5, 2, 4, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3]
Ranked data: [7, 3.5, 10, 1, 7, 3.5, 1, 7, 3.5, 3.5]

Step 2: Calculate the sum of ranks for each group.

U_A (Group A) = Sum of ranks in Group A
U_A = 7 + 3.5 + 10 + 1 + 7 = 28.5

U_B (Group B) = Sum of ranks in Group B
U_B = 3.5 + 1 + 7 + 3.5 + 3.5 = 19.5

Step 3: Calculate the U statistic.

U = min(U_A, U_B) = min(28.5, 19.5) = 19.5

Step 4: Determine the critical U value.

To find the critical U value for a significance level of 0.05 and the sample sizes of both groups (n_A = 5, n_B = 5), you can use statistical tables or a calculator. The critical U value is approximately 12 for this scenario.

Step 5: Compare the calculated U statistic with the critical U value.

The calculated U statistic (19.5) is greater than the critical U value (12) for a significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.





Answer ------ 16
Data collected: [25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70]

Step 1: Arrange the data in ascending order.
[25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70]

Step 2: Find the median (Q2) of the data.
Since there are 10 data points, the median (Q2) is the average of the two middle values, which are the 5th and 6th values in the sorted data: (45 + 50) / 2 = 47.5

Step 3: Calculate Q1, the median of the lower half of the data.
Q1 is the median of the first 5 values: (25 + 30 + 35 + 40 + 45) / 5 = 175 / 5 = 35

Step 4: Calculate Q3, the median of the upper half of the data.
Q3 is the median of the last 5 values: (50 + 55 + 60 + 65 + 70) / 5 = 300 / 5 = 60

Step 5: Calculate the IQR, which is the difference between Q3 and Q1.
IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 60 - 35 = 25

So, the interquartile range (IQR) of the customer ages is 25. This means that the middle 50% of the ages (from Q1 to Q3) falls within the range of 35 to 60 years.





Answer ------ 17
Algorithm A: [0.85, 0.80, 0.82, 0.87, 0.83]
Algorithm B: [0.78, 0.82, 0.84, 0.80, 0.79]
Algorithm C: [0.90, 0.88, 0.89, 0.86, 0.87]

Step 1: Combine the accuracy scores from all three algorithms into a single dataset.
Combined data: [0.85, 0.80, 0.82, 0.87, 0.83, 0.78, 0.82, 0.84, 0.80, 0.79, 0.90, 0.88, 0.89, 0.86, 0.87]

Step 2: Rank the combined dataset.
Ranked data: [11, 4, 5, 13, 8, 1, 5, 9, 3, 2, 15, 12, 14, 10, 8]

Step 3: Calculate the sum of ranks for each group.

Algorithm A: Sum of ranks = 11 + 4 + 5 + 13 + 8 = 41
Algorithm B: Sum of ranks = 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 2 = 20
Algorithm C: Sum of ranks = 15 + 12 + 14 + 10 + 8 = 59

Step 4: Calculate the Kruskal-Wallis H statistic.

n = total number of observations = 15
H = [(12 / (15 * (15 + 1))) * ((41² / 5) + (20² / 5) + (59² / 5))] - 3 * (15 + 1)
H = [(12 / (15 * 16)) * (841 + 400 + 3481)] - 3 * 16
H = [(12 / 240) * 4722] - 48
H = 1.95

Step 5: Determine the critical value of the Kruskal-Wallis H statistic.

To find the critical value for a significance level of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (k - 1), where k is the number of groups (k = 3), you can use statistical tables or a calculator. For this scenario, the critical value is approximately 5.991.

Step 6: Compare the calculated H statistic with the critical value.

The calculated H statistic (1.95) is less than the critical value (5.991) for a significance level of 0.05 and 3 groups. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Price (in dollars): [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
Sales: [100, 80, 90, 110, 95]

Step 1: Calculate the means of both the Price and Sales data.
mean_price = (10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 14) / 5 = 59 / 5 = 11.8
mean_sales = (100 + 80 + 90 + 110 + 95) / 5 = 475 / 5 = 95

Step 2: Calculate the differences between each data point and its respective mean for both variables.
differences_price = [10 - 11.8, 15 - 11.8, 12 - 11.8, 8 - 11.8, 14 - 11.8]
differences_sales = [100 - 95, 80 - 95, 90 - 95, 110 - 95, 95 - 95]

Step 3: Calculate the product of the differences for each data point in both variables.
product_of_differences = (10 - 11.8) * (100 - 95) + (15 - 11.8) * (80 - 95) + (12 - 11.8) * (90 - 95) + (8 - 11.8) * (110 - 95) + (14 - 11.8) * (95 - 95)
product_of_differences = -1.8 * 5 + 3.2 * -15 + 0.2 * -5 + -3.8 * 15 + 2.2 * 0
product_of_differences = -9 + -48 - 1 - 57 + 0 = -115

Step 4: Calculate the squared differences for Price.
squared_differences_price = (10 - 11.8)^2 + (15 - 11.8)^2 + (12 - 11.8)^2 + (8 - 11.8)^2 + (14 - 11.8)^2
squared_differences_price = 1.44 + 10.24 + 0.04 + 14.44 + 4.84 = 31

Step 5: Calculate the slope "a" of the regression line.
a = product_of_differences / squared_differences_price = -115 / 31 ≈ -3.71

Step 6: Calculate the y-intercept "b" of the regression line.
b = mean_sales - (a * mean_price) = 95 - (-3.71 * 11.8) = 95 + 43.978 ≈ 138.978

So, the equation of the regression line is:
Sales ≈ -3.71 * Price + 138.978

Data collected: [7, 8, 9, 6, 8, 7, 9, 7, 8, 7]

Step 1: Calculate the sample mean (x̄) of the satisfaction scores.
x̄ = (7 + 8 + 9 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 9 + 7 + 8 + 7) / 10 = 76 / 10 = 7.6

Step 2: Determine the sample size (n).
n = 10

Step 3: Calculate the sample standard deviation (s) of the satisfaction scores.
s = √((Σ(xi - x̄)²) / (n - 1))
s = √(((7 - 7.6)² + (8 - 7.6)² + (9 - 7.6)² + (6 - 7.6)² + (8 - 7.6)² + (7 - 7.6)² + (9 - 7.6)² + (7 - 7.6)² + (8 - 7.6)² + (7 - 7.6)²) / (10 - 1))
s = √((0.36 + 0.16 + 1.96 + 2.56 + 0.16 + 0.36 + 1.96 + 0.36 + 0.16 + 0.36) / 9)
s = √(8.92 / 9) ≈ √0.9911 ≈ 0.9955

Step 4: Calculate the standard error (SE) of the mean satisfaction score.
SE = s / √n
SE = 0.9955 / √10 ≈ 0.3144

Advertising Expenditure (in thousands): [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
Sales (in thousands): [25, 30, 28, 20, 26]

Step 1: Organize the data into variables.

Advertising Expenditure (X): [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
Sales (Y): [25, 30, 28, 20, 26]

Step 2: Calculate the means of both advertising expenditure and sales.

mean_X = (10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 14) / 5 = 59 / 5 = 11.8
mean_Y = (25 + 30 + 28 + 20 + 26) / 5 = 129 / 5 = 25.8

Step 3: Calculate the differences between each data point and its respective mean for both variables.

differences_X = [10 - 11.8, 15 - 11.8, 12 - 11.8, 8 - 11.8, 14 - 11.8]
differences_Y = [25 - 25.8, 30 - 25.8, 28 - 25.8, 20 - 25.8, 26 - 25.8]

Step 4: Calculate the product of the differences for each data point in both variables.

product_of_differences = (10 - 11.8) * (25 - 25.8) + (15 - 11.8) * (30 - 25.8) + (12 - 11.8) * (28 - 25.8) + (8 - 11.8) * (20 - 25.8) + (14 - 11.8) * (26 - 25.8)
product_of_differences = -1.8 * -0.8 + 3.2 * 4.2 + 0.2 * 2.2 + -3.8 * -5.8 + 2.2 * 0.2
product_of_differences = 1.44 + 13.44 + 0.44 + 22.04 + 0.44 = 37.8

Step 5: Calculate the squared differences for advertising expenditure.

squared_differences_X = (10 - 11.8)^2 + (15 - 11.8)^2 + (12 - 11.8)^2 + (8 - 11.8)^2 + (14 - 11.8)^2
squared_differences_X = 1.44 + 10.24 + 0.04 + 14.44 + 4.84 = 30

Step 6: Calculate the slope coefficients (beta values) of the regression line.

Beta_XY = product_of_differences / squared_differences_X = 37.8 / 30 = 1.26

Step 7: Calculate the y-intercept (intercept value) of the regression line.

intercept = mean_Y - (Beta_XY * mean_X) = 25.8 - (1.26 * 11.8) = 25.8 - 14.868 = 10.932

So, the equation of the multiple regression line is:

Sales (Y) = 1.26 * Advertising Expenditure (X) + 10.932
